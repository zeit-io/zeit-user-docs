# Approval procedure 

In ZEIT.IO there is an approval process for:

- Times that you have recorded directly on ZEIT.IO.
- Times that you have imported into ZEIT.IO.
- Times that you have recorded outside of ZEIT.IO.
- Expenses.
- Fixed price packages.

The approval process is an important part of the collaboration between freelancers and organizations and can be activated separately for each member in the project.

If the approval process is activated for your project membership, then you must have your times and expenses approved before they can be invoiced or you can receive a credit for them.
Times and expenses must always be submitted and approved separately because in large organizations there are often different approvers for times and expenses.

If the approval process is not activated for your project membership, then all
bookings are immediately approved and can be invoiced immediately.

!!! Info
    The [credit procedure](/freiberufler/gutschriftverfahren.en/) is only available in combination with the approval procedure.
    Without an approval procedure there are no credit notes!
