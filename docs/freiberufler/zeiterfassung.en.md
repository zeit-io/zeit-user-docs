# Time tracking 

Time recording is an elementary function in ZEIT.IO. There are several ways you can track your project times:

- **Timer**: Track your times with the timer, with start, stop and break times.
- **Calendar**: Record your times in the calendar using “drag & drop”.
- **Hourly form**: Record your times manually by duration (hours & minutes), without start and stop time.
- **Daily form**: Record your times on a daily basis, without start and stop times.
- **Import**: Import your times from another system.

There are also various clients you can use to record your times:

- **WebApp**: Record your times in the web browser on the [ZEIT.IO page](https://zeit.io/en/).
- **Browser extension**: Record your times independently from the ZEIT.IO page, with the ZEIT.IO browser extension.
- **Mobile**: Record your times on your smartphone.

## Timer

The easiest way to record is via the timer.
The timer is always located in the top left of the login area.
Regardless of the context you are in, the timer is always in the same place.
The functions of the timer are shown graphically here.

You can start, pause, continue and stop the timer at any time.
If you click on the stop symbol, a modal dialog opens in which you can complete the booking.
You only have to decide which project you want to book the time for at the end of the booking.
This is a great advantage because you don't have to decide beforehand, you can just start the timer and then decide 
later which project you want to book the time for.

Here is an example of the modal dialog that opens when you stop the timer:

Except for "Duration", all input fields in the modal dialog are editable.
This means that you can still make adjustments before saving.
If you have forgotten to track a break, you can easily add it here and also adjust the from-to times again.

The input field for "hourly rate" is a dropdown field.
Depending on the project, the hourly rate can also change.
If you have two or more hourly rates in a project, you can select the hourly rate for which you want to book the time here.
Most of the time you only have one hourly rate per project and in that case the selection field is "disabled".
In many projects, however, there is also an hourly rate for remote work and one for on-site work.
In that case, you can select the hourly rate that applies to the booked time here.

If you click "Save & Close", the time will be booked, the timer will be reset to 00:00:00 and the modal dialog will be closed again.

### Keyboard shortcuts for the timer

You can also control the timer using the keyboard. This works with these keyboard shortcuts:

- **Start**: `s`
- **Pause**: `p`
- **Resume**: `s`
- **Stop**: `e`

The form in the modal dialog can be sent using the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl + Enter` (`Command + Enter` on Mac).
This allows you to record times very quickly, even without a mouse.
