# Firefox

The [Firefox browser from Mozilla](https://www.mozilla.org/de/firefox/) is one of the most used browsers in the world.

With the [ZEIT.IO Firefox AddOn](https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/zeit-io-addon/)
you can use ZEIT.IO directly in your browser, regardless of the website you are currently on.

This extension also gives you integrations for various ticket systems.
This means that you can start the timer directly from a ticket in JIRA, for example.
And when you stop time tracking, the comment field is pre-filled with the ticket ID and ticket title.
Supported ticket systems are:

- JIRA
- GitHub
- Gitlab
- YouTrack
- Zendesk
- Trello

If you have recorded your time directly from a ticket, the ticket number in ZEIT.IO is clickable and directly linked to the ticket.
And of course you can filter by a specific ticket number and see how many hours were booked on a particular ticket.
