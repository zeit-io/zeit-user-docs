# Google 

Google is not only a search engine, but also a cloud provider.
With [Google Workspace](https://workspace.google.com/business/), Google offers a cloud-based office suite, including email accounts, user management and much more.

You can log in to ZEIT.IO with your existing Google account.
To do this, simply navigate to the [ZEIT.IO login page](https://zeit.io/de/signin) and click on the "Sign in with Google" button.
You will then be redirected to Google and asked if you want to give ZEIT.IO access to your profile information.
If you answer yes, ZEIT.IO can access the following information from your Google account:

- First name
- Last name
- Email address
- Profile picture

If you do not yet have an account with ZEIT.IO, this information will be used to create a new account for you.
If you already have an account with ZEIT.IO, the email address from your Google profile will be used to log you in to ZEIT.IO.

This offers many advantages! You don't have to remember another password.
If you are already logged in to Google in your browser, you can log in to ZEIT.IO with one click.

We use the [OAuth2 protocol](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2) for this SSO (Single Sign-On) process.
