# Integrations 

Nowadays, open interfaces and integrations with other systems are becoming increasingly important.
No system exists on its own.
Companies use different solutions from different providers.
It is of course important that data can be exchanged automatically between the systems.

ZEIT.IO has a public [REST API](https://zeit.io/api-docs/index.html) that allows both reading and writing to the data.
In addition to the REST API, there are other integrations that are listed here:

 - [Google SSO](./google.en.md)
 - [Microsoft Entra SSO](./microsoft.en.md)
