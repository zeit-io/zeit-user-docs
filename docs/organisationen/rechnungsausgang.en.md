# Outgoing invoices

You can create and send your invoices in the outgoing invoices section.
To do this, click on "Invoices" in the main menu and then on "Outgoing invoices".
There you will see a list of all invoices that have already been created.
New invoices can either be created manually, using the green "Create new invoice" button,
or automatically using the [Auto-invoicing feature](/organisationen/auto-invoicing.en/).

## CSV Export

Below the table on the right-hand side there is a link "CSV Export".
With this link you can download the current table for the outgoing invoices as a CSV file.

Each outgoing invoice is shown as a line in the CSV file.

The outgoing invoices can be filtered according to various criteria.
The CSV file contains the results of the current filter settings.

## DATEV CSV Export

If you filter the outgoing invoices according to a service month or year, an additional link "DATEV CSV Export" appears below the table on the right-hand side.
With this link you can download the current table for the outgoing invoices as a DATEV CSV file.
The DATEV CSV file contains all the outgoing invoices that were created in the selected service month or year.
Every single item on the outgoing invoice is shown as a line in the CSV file.
The file can therefore also contain more lines than the table on the website.

The file corresponds to the [DATEV booking stack format](https://developer.datev.de/datev/platform/de/dtvf/formate/buchungsstapel) and contains all the necessary information for accounting.
The DATEV CSV file can then be imported into your accounting software.
